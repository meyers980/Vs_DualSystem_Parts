# Vs_DualSystem_Parts
Items I created for my Vs DualSystem Nintendo Red Tent restore.

In this repository are several instruction marquees I either created or translated, a vector version of the coin plate for laser cutting, a 3D printing file for the tall Nintendo button spacer, and a dipswitch sheet I created to track how to set games with my Multi Vs Lite kit.
